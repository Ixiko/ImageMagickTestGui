a script by Ixiko last change: 23.06.2020

------

***This script is for a quick try of the [Imagemagick command-line tools](https://imagemagick.org/script/command-line-tools.php). On the left it shows the original image and on the right the change is displayed. Complex operations (executing multiple commands one after the other) are not possible. The commands given by the user are stored in an ini file now and can be used again the next time. I’ve done some work for a more comfortable version. It’s now possible to choose a new picture. All your settings will be saved. when you restart the script everything is just like you last finished it.***
